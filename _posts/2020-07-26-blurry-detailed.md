## An idea for representing knowledge for pedagogy

The main problem is: when trying to learn about something new, such as History, we have many options: read wikipedia, textbooks, popular history books, 'very short introductions'. All of these resources act at different granularities of detail. A textbook offers a comprehensive 'grind' through the field, starting with foundational material and then pushing onwards slowly through many topics in a rigorous fashion. Popular history books provide an introduction to topics, often keeping some level of detail out and oversimplifying certain aspects. Wikipedia contains a lot of facts, but not much structure to organise those facts. The main problem here is that as a newcomer, I have limited time and energy to focus on this, but I nevertheless want to learn about History. This means I want to understand the main foundational claims of History, as well as the relations between those concepts. I also want to know what level of granularity I'm currently at as I read.

Here's a nice analogy from Better Explained: 
![baseline_vs_progressive.png]({{site.baseurl}}/_posts/baseline_vs_progressive.png)
Most resources feel like the 1st: they add on material as you pass through the textbook. Instead I want to build up a blurry (but complete) image of the field in one pass, and then refine refine refine.

So let's say I want to learn about History. I would read the following documents
1. A 1 page summary of History
2. A 5 page summary of History
3. A 50 page summary of History
4. A 100 page minibook on History
5. A 500 page overview of history
6. A 1000 textbook on History

As I progress from 1 to 6 I have a clear idea of what concepts are being refined on, and what the relationships are between the concepts. Each document provides a 'complete' summary of the topic within that level of granularity. Then, as I 'zoom in', I would know how to situate each new idea/concept/fact I learn in the larger 'skeleton' of ideas. As I proceed I would keep adding detail to the image that I became acquainted with in the first stage. 

Ideally I would be able to choose interactively which parts of the 'image' I want to refine. Also if I 'zoom in' to one part of this space, it would be obvious to me what other part of the space is affected by what I just learned.

There are difficulties in knowing how to structure knowledge into this hierarchical way. The upper level would need to naturally 'lead into' the more refined level. If we apply this image analogy directly, we would need to be able to define concepts and their relations in a 2D space, with distance in this space corresponding to some level of similarity/relevance. We would also need a concept of 'blurriness'. Blurriness could possibly be solved by the page-number restriction.
